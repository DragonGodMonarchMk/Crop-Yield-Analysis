# Crop-Yield-Analysis
# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction & Agricultural Data Analysis Project

An end-to-end machine learning project focusing on predicting crop yields based on environmental factors, soil characteristics, and historical data. This project aims to empower agricultural stakeholders with data-driven insights for optimizing farming practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Built predictive models to forecast crop yields using **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.
- Integrated weather data (rainfall, temperature, humidity) and soil parameters (NPK, pH levels) into the model.
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify yield patterns across regions and crop types.
- Evaluated model performance using **R2 Score, MAE, RMSE**.
- Delivered actionable recommendations for **fertilizer optimization, irrigation scheduling, and yield risk assessment**.
- Developed interactive **Power BI dashboards** for visualizing insights and forecasting trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualizations)
- **Power BI / Tableau** (Dashboard Reporting)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development Environment)
